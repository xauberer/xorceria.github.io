What is the use of the knowledge about your horoscope? You can be sure that every star and planet does affect you. How &#8211; is a matter of skillful use of cosmic energies, which flow down upon us.

Exactly the same energies in the hands of experienced healers &#8211; naturetherapists literally do miracles in the service of health assistance. The same energy bring to us chances of a happy love, financial success, creative inspiration and development of consciousness. The same energy fed from the centuries the minds of mystics, philosophers, saints and scholars.

Stars do not send us an inevitable fate. The hardest influences are challenges in life, whereas the best &#8211; opportunities. All of them are chances, not destiny.


  Medieval astrologers repeated:



  &#8222;The stars govern fools, wise men govern the stars.&#8221;


We **have the stars in ourselves. These stars &#8211; are perception and awareness centers, governing vital and psychic energy. In the Indian tradition they are called lotuses or wheels (chakras) in the Western &#8211; the spheres (sefiry) or seals.**

In the Taoist tradition and Chinese Traditional Medicine there are hundreds of energy points, several major ‚central banks’ and 20 major energy channels. Working with them releases us from the automation of behavior, allows us to regain independence and integrity of Self, that we loose when confronted with adversities. **[Each day][1]**, each moment is an opportunity of freedom, happiness and success. Without exceptions.****

### **Roman Fierfas**
